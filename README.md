# Uni-Tat Iceman Call Center Analytics with Snowflake Cortex AI
At Uni-Tat Ice & Marketing, our call center operations are supported by remote agents in the Philippines. For this project, I used Snowflakeâ€™s Cortex AI to transcribe call recordings and analyse call intent, urgency, issue resolution, customer satisfaction, and agent performance.

This project and its code are designed to run within Snowflake Notebooks, which support executing both SQL queries and Python code in the same environment. Running this outside Snowflake Notebooks may require adapting the code or separate execution steps for SQL and Python parts.
