# Call Center Analytics with Snowflake Cortex AI
## Project Overview
At my current job, our call center operations are supported by remote agents in the Philippines. For this project, I used Snowflakeâ€™s Cortex AI to transcribe call recordings and analyse call intent, urgency, issue resolution, customer satisfaction, and agent performance.

This project and its code are designed to run within Snowflake and Notebooks, which support executing both SQL queries and Python code in the same environment.
